Welcome! I’m Abhinandan Bhatia, an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Physics at Shiv Nadar University (India). My academic interests lie at the intersection of abstract mathematical theory, stellar dynamics, and data-driven astrophysical modeling.

Currently, I am working on a research project analyzing the extra-tidal regions of the globular cluster NGC 7078 using Gaia EDR3 data. This work involves hybrid probabilistic modeling, including Gaussian Mixture Models and Kernel Density Estimation, as well as isochrone fitting and photometric sequence analysis.

Earlier this summer, I was selected for the Undergraduate Summer Program in Mathematics at IIIT-Delhi—a highly selective initiative that brought together students from across India for advanced coursework in algebra, analysis, topology, and geometry, alongside faculty-led research talks on topics ranging from spectral theory to random walks and mathematical logic.

I’m also deeply interested in the broader role of science and mathematics in society, and have contributed op-eds to national newspapers reflecting on the interface of science, education, and public understanding.
