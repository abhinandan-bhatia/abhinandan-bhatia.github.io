## Research Experience

**Research Intern**  
*D.S. Kothari Centre for Research and Innovation in Science Education, Miranda House, University of Delhi*  
**June–July 2025**  
- Studied extra-tidal regions of globular cluster NGC 7078 using Gaia EDR3 astrometry.  
- Developed a hybrid probabilistic model (2D GMM + KDE) for cluster–field separation.  
- Applied Bayesian classification to compute membership probabilities.  
- Built extinction-corrected CMDs; fitted PARSEC isochrones to identify cluster sequences.  
- Presented findings in a research poster; authored final project report; paper in planning.  

**Undergraduate Summer Program in Mathematics**  
*IIIT–Delhi*  
**June 2025**  
- Selected from a highly competitive national applicant pool (~10% acceptance).  
- Attended advanced modules in Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, Topology, and Geometry.  
- Participated in research-level seminars on entropy, spectral theory, projective geometry, mathematical logic, and more.  

**Independent Project**  
*Exploratory Research on Decimal Digits of Exponentiated Integers*  
- Investigated digit bounds for \(a^p\); derived inequalities relating digits and exponent.  
- Explored probabilistic models for estimating digit growth.  
- Shared work with Prof. Thomas Britz (UNSW), editor of *Parabola*; received feedback.
