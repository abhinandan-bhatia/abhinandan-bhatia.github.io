### Ongoing Research Projects

## Research Internship — D.S. Kothari Centre for Research and Innovation in Science Education  
**Miranda House, University of Delhi**  
**June – July 2025**

**Project:** *Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics on Extra-Tidal Regions of Globular Cluster NGC 7078*  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Richa Kundu

- Performed astrometric membership analysis using Gaia EDR3 proper motion and photometric data.
- Developed a hybrid probabilistic model combining 2D Gaussian Mixture Models and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for cluster–field separation.
- Applied Bayesian classification to assign membership probabilities and model tidal structure.
- Constructed and interpreted Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs), applied extinction correction, and fitted PARSEC isochrones to identify cluster sequences.
- Completed a literature survey on cluster dynamics and halo substructure.
- Presented a formal research poster and authored the full project report under mentorship.
- Collaborative paper preparation in progress.

## Undergraduate Summer Program — IIIT-Delhi  
**INT-Delhi Summer School in Mathematics**  
**June 2025**

- Selected for the highly competitive national-level summer school (∼10% acceptance rate).
- Attended advanced modules in Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, Geometry, and Topology.
- Engaged in intensive problem-solving, faculty research talks, and thematic lectures on entropy, information theory, spectral analysis, projective geometry, and random walks.
- Gained deep exposure to proof writing, abstraction, and graduate-level mathematical thinking.
