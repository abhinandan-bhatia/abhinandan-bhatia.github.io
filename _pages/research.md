### Ongoing Research Projects

#### **Astrophysical Modeling of Globular Cluster NGC 7078**
**June–July 2025**  
Under the mentorship of Dr. [Mentor's Name], Department of Physics & Astrophysics, University of Delhi

- Investigated the extra-tidal regions of the globular cluster NGC 7078 using Gaia EDR3 astrometric and photometric data.
- Developed a hybrid probabilistic framework combining 2D Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to model cluster–field separation.
- Applied Bayesian classification to assign membership probabilities and study the outer stellar structure.
- Constructed and analyzed extinction-corrected Color–Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs), and fitted PARSEC isochrones
